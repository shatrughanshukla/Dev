In Flexbox there are two concepts we need to remember,
    1. The Main Access and
    2. The other Access.
In the world of web whenever you say, Flexbox that means the main access is going to be run from left to right.
    1. The Main Access is the horizontal access.
    2. The other Access is the vertical access.
