    CSS Grid is a layout system in CSS that helps you arrange items in rows and columns on a web page.
    It gives you full control over where each item goes and how big it should be. 

    Why was Grid needed?
        Before Grid, developers mostly used Flexbox, float, and positioning to align things. 
        These had serious limitations, especially for complex multi-row + multi-column layouts.
            Here’s why Grid was needed:
            | Reason         | Explanation                                                                                                                           |
            | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
            | 2D Layout      | Flexbox is 1D (row or column, not both at once). Grid is 2D – it handles rows and columns together.                                   |
            | Better Control | With Grid, you can place items in specific cells or even span them across rows/columns.                                               |
            | Layout First   | Grid allows you to define the layout first (the structure), then place content – Flexbox is more content-first.                       |
            | Avoid Hacks    | Before Grid, developers used hacks with `float`, `position`, or even `flex-wrap` to create grid-like systems. Grid removes this need. |

    Limitations of Flexbox that Grid solves
        | Flexbox Drawback                                     | How Grid Solves It                                                                               |
        | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
        | Can’t handle complex multi-row/column layouts easily | Grid handles both dimensions simultaneously                                                      |
        | Can’t align elements into precise rows & columns     | Grid gives you full control with `grid-row`, `grid-column`, etc.                                 |
        | Hard to create full page layouts                     | Grid is perfect for page-level layouts (headers, sidebars, etc.)                                 |
        | Alignment depends on content order                   | Grid allows absolute placement (item 1 can go into column 3, row 2) regardless of HTML order     |
        | `flex-wrap` gets messy when wrapping                 | Grid has built-in row and column control – no wrapping confusion                                 |

    Flexbox is perfect when you're working line by line (either row or column) — like placing buttons in a single row, arranging cards in one direction, or building a navbar with menu items side by side.
    But the moment you want to create a grid-like layout (like a matrix or a newspaper-style structure), Flexbox starts getting confusing — it wraps and adjusts things, but you don’t get full control.
    That’s where CSS Grid becomes the hero — you can clearly say, “this item should go in column 2 and row 3,” without using any tricky workarounds.

                That's the step 1, but it doesn't do much, at least the flex the moment you say display flex, it does something automatically.
                The reason why it's not doing anything because there are two main requirement to told to this grid. How many rows you want and how many caloumns you want.
                So you need to specify the rules that what is you expectation with rows and columns? Usualy it starts from column, and column goes from top to bottom.

            So, if we go ahead and try to have like fourth element automatically that's going to be shifted to the next row. Because grid doesn't know, you didn't said anything about four elements, we just said bout three elements.
            So it's trying best to fit three elements.  The fourth one I don't know what to do it, so I'll jusy push it to the next row. That's the default behaviour.

               Turns out in the row, you can mention that you want to control the first row and alloted 100pxand the second row that will come, if it happens will get 200px.
