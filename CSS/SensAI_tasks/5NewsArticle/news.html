            On June 26, 2025, Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla became the first Indian to dock with the International
            Space Station (ISS), marking a monumental milestone in India’s space journey. He was part of Axiom Mission 4
            (Ax-4), which launched aboard SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center on June 25. The
            mission is a collaborative effort involving NASA, Axiom Space, and ISRO, with the goal of conducting
            microgravity experiments developed by Indian researchers. Shukla will spend approximately two weeks aboard
            the ISS, working on scientific studies supported by the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) and ISRO. His
            journey echoes the legacy of Wing Commander Rakesh Sharma, the first Indian in space in 1984. The successful
            launch and docking have ignited nationwide pride, with emotional reactions from his hometown of Lucknow and
            congratulations pouring in from Indian officials, ISRO scientists, and international space agencies.
            Shukla’s mission is expected to significantly contribute to India's growing role in global space exploration
            and deepen international cooperation in science and technology.
