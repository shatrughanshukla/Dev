        <p class="first-paragraph">
            This is the first paragraph. It wraps around the first image that is floated to the left. Notice how this
            paragraph flows around the image.

        <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/150" alt="Right Float" class="float-right" />

        <p class="second-paragraph clear-left">
            This is the second paragraph with <strong>clear: left</strong>. It starts below the first image
            (left-floated).
        </p>

        <p class="second-paragraph clear-right">
            Now this same paragraph has <strong>clear: right</strong>. It starts below the second image (right-floated).
        </p>

        <p class="second-paragraph clear-both">
            Finally, with <strong>clear: both</strong>, the paragraph starts after both floated images.
