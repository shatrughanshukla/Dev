1. How floats work in your layout
2. Why the `.row` collapses (a common bug)
3. How `clearfix` fixes it using `::after`


1. How Floats Work in Your Layout

In your HTML, you’ve got this:

<div class="row">
  <div class="column-2">Column 1</div>
  <div class="column-2">Column 2</div>
</div>

Your CSS for `.column-2`:

```css
.column-2 {
  float: left;
  width: 50%;
}
```
What Happens:

* `float: left` makes the columns **come out of normal document flow**.
* But they **stay visually next to each other**, like inline elements — this is how the layout becomes horizontal (2-column or 3-column).
* This float trick is used to build layouts **before Flexbox/Grid existed**.

---

2. **Why the `.row` Collapses**

Even though two `.column-2` divs are visually inside `.row`, they are floated.

### So, What’s the Problem?

> Floated elements are **removed from normal flow**, so the parent `.row` doesn’t "see" them — meaning `.row` calculates **its height as zero**.

This causes the next element (like the footer) to **rise up and overlap** the floated content.

Use Inspect Element:

Right-click the `.row` in your browser → **Inspect**.

You’ll notice:

* `.row` has no visible height.
* It’s like an empty div (even though it *looks* like it has content).

---

3. How `clearfix` Fixes It**

Add this to your CSS:

```css
.row::after {
  content: "";
  display: block;
  clear: both;
}
```

### What this does:

| Line             | Meaning                                                                     |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `::after`        | Adds a fake invisible element **after** all children in `.row`              |
| `content: ""`    | The element has no text content                                             |
| `display: block` | It behaves like a block-level box                                           |
| `clear: both`    | Pushes this fake block **below all floated elements** on the left and right |

Result:

* This `::after` block now sits **after all your floated columns**.
* It pushes the bottom of `.row` downward to include all the floated elements.
* This **restores the height** of `.row` to what you visually expect it to be.

---

Final Visual Result (After Fix):

```css
.row::after {
  content: "";
  display: block;
  clear: both;
}
```

Now:

* `.row` behaves like a box that fully wraps its floated children.
* No overlapping footer.
* Layout is clean and intact.

Summary

| Concept                   | Explanation                                                                     |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `float: left`             | Removes element from normal flow and aligns it to the left                      |
| `.row` collapses          | Because its children are floated and don't take up space in flow                |
| `clearfix` with `::after` | Adds a hidden element that **clears floats**, restoring proper height to `.row` |
| Why this matters          | Prevents layout bugs, overlapping, or broken containers                         |
