 What is <!DOCTYPE html>? -> It's called a document type declaration (or doctype for short).
                             It tells the browser:
                             "Hey browser, this is an HTML5 document — render it accordingly."

 HyperText -> “Text that links to other text”, e.g. <a href="https://google.com">Go to Google</a>

 Markup -> “tags used to structure content”, 
                You’re not programming or styling here — you’re just marking or labeling parts of the content:
                <h1> = heading
                <p> = paragraph
                <img> = image
                <ul> = list
                e.g. <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

 Language -> It’s called a language because:
                It has rules and syntax
                Browsers understand and interpret it
                You "speak" to the browser with it
                But it’s not a programming language — it’s a markup language.

 Final Meaning -> HTML is a language used to mark and structure text (using tags), 
                  and it can also include links (hypertext) to connect different pages or sections.
                  It tells the browser:
                  “Hey, this is a heading” → show it big
                  “Hey, this is a paragraph” → format it normally
                  “Hey, this is a link” → make it clickable

 HTML is the main language used to structure and design content on web pages.
 It tells the browser what to show (text, images, links, etc.) and how to organize it.
 Think of HTML like the skeleton of a web page — it gives shape and structure.

Example Explained
The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document

The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
    Everything inside your webpage is written inside these tags.
    Think of it like the outer box that holds your full webpage.

The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page
    This is the head section — it contains info about the page, not visible content.
    Example things in <head>:
    Title of the page
    Links to CSS files
    Meta info like charset or description
    Scripts

The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
The <h1> element defines a large heading
    🧢 <h1> is the largest heading.
    There are 6 heading levels: <h1> (biggest) to <h6> (smallest).

The <p> element defines a paragraph
The <br> element is a line break tag. 
The <hr> element is a horizontal line tag.
