HTML Attributes
    All HTML elements can have attributes
    Attributes provide additional information about elements
    Attributes are always specified in the start tag
    Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"

HTML LINKS: HTML links are defined with the <a> tag:
    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a>
    The link's destination is specified in the href attribute, href stands for "Hypertext REFerence".
    Attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements.

HTML IMAGES: HTML images are defined with the <img> tag.
    The source file (src), alternative text (alt), width, and height are provided as attributes:
    <img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="104" height="142">
    src = source
        It tells the browser where to find the image file.
        This can be:
        A file name (w3schools.jpg) if it‚Äôs in the same folder
        Or a full URL (https://example.com/image.jpg) if it's online
    alt="W3Schools.com"
        alt = alternative text
        This text shows up if the image fails to load.
        Also helps screen readers (for visually impaired users)
        Important for accessibility and SEO (search engines)
    width="104" and height="142"
        These set the size of the image in pixels.
        You can control how big or small the image looks on the page.
    It is a self-closing tag ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt need a </img>

Style Attribute: The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.
    <p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>

Lang Attribute: You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page.
    This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.
    The following example specifies English as the language:
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en">
        <body>
        ...
        </body>
        </html>

    Country codes can also be added to the language code in the lang attribute. 
    So, the first two characters define the language of the HTML page, and the last two characters define the country.
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en-US">
        <body>
        ...
        </body>
        </html>
                | Feature             | How `lang` helps                                   |

                | üßë‚Äçü¶Ø Accessibility    | Screen readers speak in correct language           |
                | üåç Tools            | Auto-translators, spell checkers work better       |

Title Attribute: The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.
                 The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element:
                    <p title="I'm a tooltip">This is a paragraph.</p>
                        A tooltip is a small popup box that appears when you hover your mouse over an element (like text, image, button, etc.).

//  Always Use Lowercase Attributes
//  Always Quote Attribute Values
//  Single or Double Quotes?
        Double quotes around attribute values are the most common in HTML, but single quotes can also be used.
        In some situations, when the attribute value itself contains double quotes, it is necessary to use single quotes:
            <p title='John "ShotGun" Nelson'>
                Or vice versa:
            <p title="John 'ShotGun' Nelson">
