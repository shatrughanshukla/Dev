HEADING
HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.
<h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading.
        Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.
        Users often skim a page by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the document structure.
        <h1> headings should be used for main headings, followed by <h2> headings, then the less important <h3>, and so on.
    Note: Use HTML headings for headings only. Don't use headings to make text BIG or bold.
            Bigger Headings
                Each HTML heading has a default size. However, you can specify the size for any heading with the style attribute, 
                using the CSS font-size property:
                    Example
                    <h1 style="font-size:60px;">Heading 1</h1>

PARAGRAPHS
A paragraph always starts on a new line and is usually a block of text, browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.

HTML Display
    You cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed.
    Large or small screens, and resized windows will create different results.
    With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.
    The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed:

The HTML <pre> Element:
    The HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text.
    The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks:
        <pre>
        My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

        My Bonnie lies over the sea.

        My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

        Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
        </pre>
