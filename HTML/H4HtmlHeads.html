what does <meta> mean?
    meta = metadata
    Metadata = "data about data" → it gives information about the page, not shown on the page itself.
    The <meta> tag always goes inside the <head> and helps browsers, search engines, or devices understand the page better.
    
1. <meta charset="UTF-8">
        What it means:
            This tells the browser:
            "Use UTF-8 character encoding for this page."

            What is UTF-8?
            UTF-8 is a universal character set.

            It supports all languages, symbols, emojis — everything.

            Without this, some characters might look like � or show garbage symbols.
            Example:
                <meta charset="UTF-8">
            Ensures that letters like ñ, ₹, €, ❤️ are shown correctly.

2. <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        What it does:
            Makes your website responsive — i.e., it looks good on phones, tablets, laptops.
            Without this, your website may look zoomed out or broken on mobile.
         Breakdown:
            name="viewport": We’re talking about how the visible screen (viewport) behaves.
            content="..." contains settings:
            width=device-width: Set the page width equal to the device’s width (mobile = narrow, laptop = wide)
            initial-scale=1.0: Zoom level is 1.0 (no zoom)
            Example:
                <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial scale=1.0">
