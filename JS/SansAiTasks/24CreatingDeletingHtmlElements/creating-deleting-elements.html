Creating and Deleting HTML Elements

    Objective: Understand how to manipulate the DOM by adding and removing elements programmatically on a user action handled by event listeners.

        Create the HTML Structure:

            Create a new HTML file named creating-deleting-elements.html.
            Define the basic structure of an HTML document with <html>, <head>, and <body> tags.
            Create a separate JavaScript file named creating-deleting-elements.js.
            Inside the <body> of your HTML, add a <script> tag and reference the JavaScript file (creating-deleting-elements.js).
            Inside the <body>, add a <ul> element with an ID "list". Add two buttons: One with the ID "addButton" labeled "Add Item" and another with the ID "removeButton" labeled "Remove Last Item".

        Dynamically Create and Add <li> Items to the <ul>:

            In JavaScript, create a function called addListItem that creates a new <li> element. Set its text content to "New Item X" where X is the current number of <li> items plus 1. Append the new <li> element to the <ul> with the ID "list".
            Add an event listener to the "addButton" so that each time the button is clicked, a new <li> item is added to the list.

        Remove the Last <li> Element:

            In JavaScript, create a function called removeLastListItem that fetches the <ul> element using getElementById. Remove the last <li> element from the <ul> (if any exist) using lastElementChild and removeChild.
            Add an event listener to the "removeButton" so that each time the button is clicked, the last <li> item is removed from the list.
