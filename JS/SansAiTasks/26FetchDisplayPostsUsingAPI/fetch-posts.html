    Fetch and Display Posts Using API

        Objective: Understand how to fetch and display data from an API by making GET requests, manipulating the DOM to dynamically generate and display content, and handling errors programmatically using JavaScript.

            Create the HTML and JavaScript Structure:

                Create a new HTML file named fetch-posts.html.
                Define the basic structure of an HTML document with <html>, <head>, and <body> tags.
                Create a separate JavaScript file named fetch-posts.js.
                Inside the <body> of your HTML, add a <script> tag and reference the JavaScript file.
                Inside the <body>, add an empty <div> element with an ID of "posts" where all the fetched posts will be displayed.
                This <div> will serve as the container for all the posts that will be dynamically generated through JavaScript.

            Fetch All Posts from the JSONPlaceholder API:

                In the JavaScript file, use the fetch() function to make a GET request to the JSONPlaceholder API endpoint: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts.
                Once the data is fetched, convert the response to JSON format using .json() and store the result.

            Display the Posts on the Webpage:

                For each post fetched from the API, create a new <div> element in JavaScript.
                Inside each <div>, display the post's details: userId, id, title, and body.
                Append each <div> to the container <div> in the HTML.

            Handle Errors:

                Implement error handling for the API request using .catch() to log any potential errors (e.g., network issues).
