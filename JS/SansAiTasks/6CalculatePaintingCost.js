    Calculate Painting Cost for Different Shapes

        Define Callback Functions for Area Calculations:

            Define a callback function named areaOfRectangle that takes the length and width of a rectangle and returns the area.
            Define a callback function named areaOfCircle that takes the radius of a circle and returns the area. Use the formula Ï€ * radius^2.
            Define a callback function named areaOfTriangle that takes the base and height of a triangle and returns the area. Use the formula 0.5  base  height.

        Define calculatePaintingCost Function:

            Define a function named calculatePaintingCost that accepts three parameters: dimension1, dimension2, and calculateArea (a callback function that specifies the area calculation for a shape).
            Inside calculatePaintingCost, call the calculateArea function with dimension1 and dimension2 as arguments to get the area.
            Then, define a constant costPerUnit to represent the cost of painting per square unit (e.g., $2 per square unit).
            Calculate the total cost by multiplying the area by costPerUnit.
            The function should return the total cost.

        Call calculatePaintingCost with Different Callback Functions:

            Call calculatePaintingCost with dimensions for a rectangle (e.g., length = 5, width = 10) and the areaOfRectangle callback function. Log the result to the console.
            Call calculatePaintingCost with dimensions for a circle (e.g., radius = 3) and the areaOfCircle callback function. Note: Pass null for the second dimension as it's not needed. Log the result to the console.
            Call calculatePaintingCost with dimensions for a triangle (e.g., base = 6, height = 8) and the areaOfTriangle callback function. Log the result to the console.
